                            <p><a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> is a great product. I use it quite often myself. It lets you share stories of your life with friends and the world. But sometimes, it is pretty challenging to just use one photo to tell a compelling story. No wonder a Google search for <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how+to+make+a+collage+on+instagram">“how to create collages on Instagram”</a> returns over 9 million results.</p>
                            <p>This is the prototype and I will explain how I got there ☺</p>
                            <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/99034774" width="337" height="337" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
                            <h3>Problem</h3>
                            <p>I noticed that many Instagram users post photo collages—pictures with multiple different photographs arranged in an artful way, often telling a little story. But, to get these collages into Instagram, users must currently use 3rd party apps. These apps don’t offer the same great user experience as Instagram does, and are usually quite buggy.<br><br>

                            My goal here is to solve this problem — to let users share multiple photos at once easily, simply, and beautifully.</p><br>
                            <h3>Project</h3>
                            <p>As a design challenge, I researched, ideated, wireframed, and prototyped a collage feature for Instagram users. This feature is simple to use, and consistent with the updated Instagram UI. It gives users more freedom to capture the moments they love and tell compelling visual stories.</p><br>
                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>As the user researcher and product designer, my role is to develop:</p><br>

                            <p>• Persona • User Stories • User Task Flows • Wireframes •User Interface Design • Prototype •Usability Test</p><br>
                            <h3>Epics</h3>
                            <p>An epic is a large scale user story that provides an overview of a feature — a high level design story. It helps me fully think through my designs. Here are the epics I’m addressing with this project.<br><br>

                            Users can create, edit, view, share and delete image collages.</p><br>
                            <h3>Design Stories</h3>
                            <p>Writing design stories is a very helpful agile technique to capture product functionality. They are detailed descriptions of what the users can do. Here are some of the design stories for my feature.<br><br>

                            Users can: take/select multiple pictures and use them to create a photo collage; edit photos in photo collages; choose collage templates; reposition and replace photos in collages; view collages; cancel making a photo collage; add captions to the collage; add location, tag people in the collage; share the collage, etc.</p><br>
                            <h3>Persona Development</h3>
                            <p>To try and understand the people I am designing for, I created a persona. This persona will guide my feature development and help me focus on the key problem I am solving. It makes the design decisions less abstract and more human.<br><br>

                            Below is the persona that I created for this photo collage feature. Meet Lucy:</p><br>
                            <a href="img/instagram/personalucy.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/instagram/personalucy.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="instagram_header_img"></a><br><br>
                            <h3>User Task Flow</h3>
                            <p>Some people think of Instagram as a camera and some people think of it more as a photo editing app. Instagram recently included a lot more editing features into the application, but they kept the camera experience very clean. I chose to preserve this user flow, and put my new photo collage feature within Instagram’s editing section. I’ve included my user flow chart below. The highlighted section is the main flow of my new feature.</p><br><br>
                            <a href="img/instagram/InstagramWorkflow.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/instagram/InstagramWorkflow.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="instagram_header_img"></a><br><br>
                            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                            <p>My next step was starting to visualize my new user task flow. I started with sketches on paper. I had a few different versions, but ended up deciding that the version below was the most promising. After some quick usability tests, this version enabled users to create collages the quickest and easiest. (There will be another post about why I did not choose the other designs. Oh iterations☺)</p><br><br>

                            <p>Below are the detailed wireframes I developed based on the sketches above. I assumed that maximum of 3 photos in a collage would be the best for the feature for now, because it would give users just enough flexibility and control to enjoy the process of making and sharing photo collages. This is still a hypothesis that needs more testing. My assumption is based on user interviews, the size limitation of the mobile devices and the ease of use to create something with quality.</p><br><br>

                            <h3>Prototype</h3>
                            <p>I tested my low fidelity wireframes with some colleagues and created a quick high fidelity prototype to test more. This prototype helps me further test my user task flow and catch any errors in the early stage. I am going to do more usability testing in the future to validate this design.<br><br>

                            Below is the video you just saw earlier, demonstrating how users might use this photo collage feature in Instagram.</p><br><br>

                            <h3>The next steps will be:</h3>
                            <P>• Validating my design<br>
                            • Usability test<br>
                            • Make Adjustments<br>
                            • Iterate<br><br>
                            As an avid and happy user of Instagram, I had a great time working on this project. I’d love to see this feature in the real app someday. It would be great to see if a collage feature would work well and get data from users to iterate.<br><br>

Or tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/linafab">@linafab</a> Would love to hear what you think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve this feature, I’d love to hear!</p><br><br>

                            <h3>Problem</h3>
                            <p>Not only am I into UX and product, I am also very into visual design and illustration. But up until this point, I had no website dedicated to the 2nd biggest hobby of mine. To solve this personal problem, I decided to craft a fun visual design portfolio for myself. </p><br>
                            <h3>Project </h3><br>
                            <p>This is a mini project I hacked over 1 week for myself. 
                            The goal here is to showcase my visual designs in a fun interactive way. I want it to be easy to interact and fun to play around with. I also want it to to look beautiful on top of that.<br>
                            I designed and developed this website from scratch. The projects listed in this webiste design are all my previous works.</p>
                            <h3>Process</h3><br>
                            <p>To guide myself through the design process, and keep me focused. I made this site-map. It includes the items I want to have on my website.</p><br>
                            <a href="img/Linsite/sitemap.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/Linsite/sitemap.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                            <p>To help myself understand the current visual portfolio situations, I researched portfolio designs on the Internet. This is the initial sketch afterwards. <br> I want it to be different from other portfolio sites but I also want to keep it simple and easy to understand. I still want my visitors to focus on my work and I want them to have an easy time navigating around the site.</p><br>
                            <a href="img/Linsite/sketch.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/Linsite/sketch.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                            

                            <p>I did variations of sketches to explore the best option. Based on my works, how I want to present myself and quick feedbacks from my friends, I decided on this design shown below. The sketches demonstrate how the "fun" in my design works. After I released it, many of my friends told me they did have fun playing around on my website.</p><br><br>
                            <img src="img/Linsite/exploreidea.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>I prototyped the interactions and it is shown in this video below.</p>

                            <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/101903425?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <br><br><br>

                            <h3>Website</h3><br>
                            <h3>Logo Design</h3>
                            <p>I wanted to show my roots in Chinese, so my logo consists two parts - my name in Chinese character and my name in English. I want my logo to be unique and simple. I used solid and transparent whites to create contrast. This works well on the background picture I selected.</p>
                            <a href="img/Linsite/logodesign.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/Linsite/logodesign.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                            <p>Below is my landing page. I made it very "visual" so that people who visit get an instant idea that this is a visual design portfolio.</p><br>
                            <img src="img/Linsite/mylandingpage.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br>
                            <p>I had some ideas of presenting my projects on each page. Below are some of them.</p>
                            <a href="img/Linsite/explore.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/Linsite/explore.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                            <p>I finally decided to go with a simpler, more straight-forward design as shown below. This design is more consistent and easier for users to understand.</p>

                            <h3>The project pages</h3><br> 

                            <p>The goal here is to present my visual designs in a clear, playful way. <br><br>

                            Projects are selected to reflect my visual skills in different areas  —  Product, Print, Apparel, etc.</p><br>
                            <h3>Illustrations Page</h3>

                            <p>I’m a big indie music fan and I use Spotify everyday. It provides the soundtrack to my heart. But, just like any great product, there is still room for improvement. A quick usability test reveals that people run into critical issues using some Spotify features.</p><br>
                            <h3>Objective</h3>
                            <p>Identify the pain points of finding, organizing and sharing music within Spotify web application on the desktop.</p><br>

                            <p><strong>What:</strong> Spotify web app<br><br>

                            <strong>Who:</strong> Eight existing Spotify users who listen to music everyday (not necessarily using Spotify)<br><br>

                            <strong>Where:</strong> San Francisco</p><br><br>
                            <h3>Participant selection:</h3>
                            <p>I created a persona before I conducted my user tests. I used the persona to select my participants. Meet my persona, Nick!</p><br><br>

                            <h3>Test tasks:</h3>
                            <p>1. Create a personal playlist<br>
                            2. Add song(s) to the playlist<br>
                            3. Edit the playlist and share it<br>
                            4. Subscribe to (follow) artists<br><br>
                            I determined the tasks based on the essential needs of using online music streaming services. I phrased the tasks as open-ended scenarios to avoid leading the participants to complete the task in a predetermined way.</p><br><br>

                            <p>The eight usability tests were recorded using QuickTime. I reviewed the recordings, took notes, identified and prioritized usability issues.</p><br>

                            <p>As you can see, there are a lot of issues going on here and I am not going to address them all in one single post. Instead, let’s take a look at some of the focused changes that may make using Spotify a more enjoyable experience.</p><br><br>
                            <h3>Issue 1</h3>
                            <h4>Search results hard to filter</h4>
                            <p><strong>Users expect to be able to customize their search results.</strong></p><br>
                            <p><i>“The reason I don’t use Spotify is that it is so hard for me to find anything.” — User</i><p><br>
                            <p>The picture below demonstrates that the user wanted to find a song that contained “tourist” in the title. The user typed “tourist” into the search bar, but the results were impossible to sort or filter. The user could not find the intended song.</p><br>
                            <a href="img/spotifytest/searchsong.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="img/spotifytest/searchsong.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a>
                            <p><strong>How about we try this?</strong><br><br>

                            Allow users to sort/filter song lists by artist or album or even date of release.</p><br><br>
                             <a href="img/spotifytest/searchsongRevise2.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="img/spotifytest/searchsongRevise2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                             <h3>Get to the next level</h3><br>

                            <p>Talented and well-respected designer <a href="https://twitter.com/dburka">Daniel Burka</a> kindly pointed out that “…users aren’t trying to sort results better…they’re trying to filter the results.”<br><br>

                            In the case of Spotify’s filtering system, shown below— They have filters such as “Albums”, “Artists”, “Profiles”, “Playlists” and “Songs” (I discussed this earlier). But the way Spotify lays out these filters confuses users — they are visually too similar.</p><br><br>

                            <p><strong>How about we try this?</strong></p>

                            <p>There is an opportunity to subtly differentiate these kinds of results that I’ve detailed below.</p>

                            <h3>Issue 2</h3>
                            <h4>The tooltips are confusing.</h4>
                            <p><strong>Users expect the “+” to mean “add to,” instead of “save,” “follow,” or “blank.”</strong></p><br>
                            <p><i>“By clicking on it, I thought it would add the song to my playlist. Where does it save to?” — User<br>
                            “Gosh, this is confusing!” — User<br><br>
                            “Why is there such a function?” — User</i><p><br><br>
                            <p>Every participant clicked the “+” sign to add their first song to their playlist. Half of the participants still accidentally clicked on it even after they realized that it was wrong. This icon also appears to be “follow” and “null” on different pages, as shown below. The inconsistency confused the participants.<p><br>

                            <p><i><center>When moused over the “+”, it says “save” but no one knew what this meant or where the song was saved to. (As of May 21st, 2014)</center></i></p>

                            <p><i><center>“+” here means “Follow” which is confusing because it previously meant “save.”</center></i></p>

                            <p><i><center>On the playlist page,this button has no tool tip, which is obviously not helpful</center></i></p>

                            <p><strong>How about we try this?</strong></p>

                            <p>Give the “+” icon an “add to” function, which enables users to choose which playlist they want to “save” the song to.</p>

                            <h3>Issue 3</h3>
                            <h4>Why am I following?</h4>
                            <p><strong>The “Follow” button is a mystery to users.</strong></p><br>

                            <p>The “Follow” button confused all the participants. Each one thought the artists they followed should be listed under the “Follow” button on the left panel, but they are not.</p>
                            <p><i> “Where are my followed artists?” — User<br><br>
                            “What does ‘following’ mean?” — User<br><br>
                            “I’d still just use Search to find the artist instead of using this ‘following’ thing.” — User</i></p><br>

                            <p>The participants expected the “Follow” page to show them a list of the artists they are already following. Instead, the page has only the three options illustrated below.</p><br>
                            <a href="img/spotifytest/FollowWhat.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/spotifytest/FollowWhat.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a>
                            <p><i><center>The Follow button on the left panel actually takes users to a page to do the action “follow”.</i></center></p>
                            <br>
                            <p><strong>How about we try this?</strong></p><br>

                            <p>Add the “followed artists” section into the “Follow” page. Show news feed, tour dates, and merchandise information as a clear option. A design recommendation is shown below.</p>

                            <p><strong>Get to the next level</strong></p><br>

                            <p>There’s no doubt Spotify’s current design is clean, but is it informative enough? At this point, could replacing icons with named features benefit the User Experience without damaging the visual elegance?</p><br>

                            <p><i>“Having to hover over a button to deduce its purpose is poor UI even if it’s super compact. ”— <a href="https://twitter.com/dburka">@Daniel Burka</a></i></p><br>
                            <p>I did additional user interviews around this concept and found a few problematic organizational problems in the navigation panel.<p><br><br>
                            <a href="img/spotifytest/update03.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="img/spotifytest/update03.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a>
                            <p><i><center>The original Spotify navigation panel.</center></i></p><br>
                            <p>I also think the big buttons are more appropriate for the touch-screen devices, and a more traditional desktop application (e.g., iTunes) approach would make it easier for users to understand on desktops.<br><br>

                            So in an attempt to bring more information to the surface of the interface , I made some design suggestions as shown below:</p><br>

                            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                            <p>• Validating my design recommendations<br>
                            • Test more <br>
                            • Iterate </p><br><br>
                            <p>The goal of user research is to understand the target user’s needs and motivations so that we can develop products that they truly love. I’ll be using these needs and motivations to drive the development of the product at each subsequent step of my design process.<br><br>

                            Note: I do not work for or represent Spotify. I chose Spotify because I use it everyday and I love it — I would like to make it even better so that more music lovers can enjoy music the way they want to. I am a UX designer studying advanced shipping methods under Kate Rutter and Laura Klein @ Tradecraft. I hope to use my design skills to make products serve people better. ☺<br><br>

                            <hr class="star-primary">

                            <p><a href="http://hint.com">Hint Health</a> is an advanced membership management and billing platform for direct primary healthcare providers(Usually referred to as DPC providers).</p><br><br>
                            <h3>Problem</h3>
                            <p>The current DPC providers have problems managing their patients. For example, it is hard for the providers to track patients status - active or inactive, whether or not they are covered by the 3rd party (their employers), etc. It is also hard for the providers to keep track of late payments. Here, I need to solve the problem for the providers, so that they can spend more time with their patients, less time on the admin work.<br></p><br>

                            <h3>Project</h3>
                                <p>I researched, ideated, wireframed, and prototyped a patient management dashboard for Hint Health. The dashboard is easy for users to understand and use. Streamlined with Hint’s other services.</p><br><br>
                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>• User Research • Persona • User Stories • User Task Flows <br>
                            • Interface Design • Prototype</p><br>
                            <h3>Process</h3>
                            <h3>User Research</h3> 
                            <p>I studied the DPC models and current practice situations in the States. Through user interviews with the DPC practitioners, I got to understand their current pain points and what they need to provide better services to their patients — less admin work so they the providers can spend more time on the patients, etc.<br><br>I took the pain points down on post-its, selected the ones that are most relevant to the feature I’m designing as the picture shown below.</p><br>
                            <a href="img/dashboard/Painpoints.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/dashboard/Painpoints.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br><br>

                            <h3>Hint Health Brand</h3>
                            <p>• Deliberate<br> 
                                • Dependable & Responsive<br>
                                • Transparent<br>
                                • Transformative<br>
                                • User-centered<br>
                                </p><br>


                            <h3>Persona</h3> 
                            <p>Based on my user interview results, I developed two personas for the project. They are shown as below.</p><br>
                            <a href="img/dashboard/Persona01.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="img/dashboard/Persona01.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br><br>

                            <h3>Epics</h3>
                            <p>DPC providers can view and manage, bill patients easily.</p><br>
                            <h3>Design Stories</h3>  
                            <p>DPC providers can use Hint Health patient management dashboard to: add new patients; view existing patients information; edit patients; bill patients; notify patients; keep track of patients enrollment/payment statuses, etc.</p><br>
                            <h3>Task Flows</h3>
                            <a href="img/dashboard/HintHealthDashboard.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/dashboard/HintHealthDashboard.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br><br>
                            <p> After discussion with Hint Health, the main task flow I'm working with here is simplified as the image shown below.</p><br>

                            <p>It helps me focus on what need to be considered for the first version of Hint Health Patient Dashboard.</p><br>


                            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                            <p>Based on my task flows and user needs, I developed the wireframes for this feature. This feature is being developed by Hint Health dev team right now. The yellow notes explain the new features I added. They are also for the engineers to reference to.</p><br>

                            <h3>Mockups</h3> 
                            <p>Hint Health uses Bootstrap as their template. Below are some of the style guide specs I used.</p><br>

                            <p>This is the final mocks I have for them for this feature. It is the same style that Hint.com follows.</p>

                            <h3>Project</h3>
                            <p>This project is to improve the existing Telecure landing page (up until July, 2014). The landing page is not mobile responsive and is not optimized. <br><br> Key Pain Points: <br>• Website design/style is not consistent <br>• Font sizes/leadings make it harder for users to read/understand <br>• Unnecessary space with no information given <br>• Unclear value proposition<br>• Content is not optimized for mobile users<br>• Website is not trustworthy enough <br></p>
                            <h3>The old Telecure Landing Page</h3>
                            <p>Desktop Version<br>I highlighted some of the parts that need to be optimized or removed.</p>

                            <img src="img/telecure/origin.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><br>
                            <p>Mobile Version</p>
                            <a href="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo1.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a>
                            <a href="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo2.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a>
                            <a href="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo3.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a>
                            <p>As you can see, their old landing page really needs to be optimized.</p><br>
                            <h3>Mobile First</h3>
                            <p>The challenge here is to avoid as many differences as possible as the widths of the devices change. I want to aim for a beautiful user experience for all of them. </p><br>

                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>My goal here is to tackle all the major pain points listed above and to improve the overall Telecure website experience. I researched, wireframed and re-designed the website. I tried to maintain their original design framework as requested by the client.<br>
                            <p>Telecure also decided to use "zombie people" (shown below) in their design, and I was asked to apply these characters. I also added a page for their new iOS app.</p>
                            <a href="img/telecure/ZomPeople.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/ZomPeople.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                            <h3>Who Am I Designing For?</h3>
                            <p>There are mostly 3 types of people Telecure is targeting at.<br>• People who do not have insurance and have difficulty accessing any doctors;<br>• People who do have insurance but they are in a rush (for example, traveling) and cannot wait long to make appointments with doctors;<br>• People with insurance who do not mind spending some money to save themselves some time.</p><br><br>
                            <p>They also share one thing in common - they all need trustworthy medical help fast. So the Telecure website really should be able to offer the information they need so they can be convinced.</p><br>

                            <h3>Start From Sketches</h3>
                            <p>I started to sketch some of the key screens. The idea is to keep the website consistent through out each section.</p><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/sketch01.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/sketch01.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/sketch02.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/sketch02.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                             <h3>Style Guide</h3>
                             <p>Once I have the rough idea of how the website should go, I started to develope a rough style guide. It helps keep the design consistent. I discussed this with the developer and we agreed on the brand colors. From there, I developed the style guide as shown below.(I also referenced <a href="http://www.typogui.de/" target="_blank"> this website</a> for Typography advices.</p>

                            <h3>Mobile Design</h3><br>
                            <p>After the wireframes, I started to design the high-fidelity prototypes. Using the style guide, I was able to keep the design consistent. I believe that the pain points I listed earlier were all solved with this design. The final version was shown to the clients and they were happy with it :)<br>This is what it looks like on different devices as shown below.</p>
                            <p>iPhone 5/5s</p><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/telecureCombo1.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureCombo1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/telecureCombo2.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureCombo2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <p>iPad samples</p><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/telecureipadCombo.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureipadCombo.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <p>Desktop version</p><br><br> 
                             <p>As you can see, while the width of the device increases, the content change slightly. More "zombie people" are added to the background. "How it works" expanded into one line, etc.</p>

                            <p>iriS is a project I worked on with my friend Yusuke (Who developed ProducTind). The idea of this app is to help people solve their problems when they are driving.</p><br>
                            <p>Below is a quick prototype I made. I will explain how I got there.</p>

                            <h3>Problem</h3>
                            <p>A lot of people have to drive for hours everyday. While you are driving, there are many things you cannot do or cannot do well. iriS is designed to help with it.</p><br>

                            <h3>Project</h3>
                            <p>This is a side project I did to help my friend. He has the core concept and developed the app functions. I helped him design the UX and visual parts of the product. I researched, ideated and wireframed the main product. I designed the UI for this app and made all the assets for the production and my friend Yusuke made the beta version app.</p><br>

                            <h3>Whiteboard Prep</h3>
                            <p>I had this whiteboard session with Yusuke so that we both are on the same page.</p>

                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>• Persona •User stories •User Task Flows • Wireframes •UI design •Production assets</p><br>

                            <h3>Epic</h3>
                            <p>User can get well instructed assistance on complicated location finding requests from iriS app operators while driving.</p><br>

                            <h3>Design Stories</h3>
                            <p>User can ask for recommendations on specific locations - 4 star restaurants near where the user is that have parking and take reservation; cool events happening near specific places and details; best hotel options ahead of the road, etc; User can also get directions sent to their mobile device and be guided to the locations; User can rate the service; User can report problems, etc.</p><br>

                            <h3>Persona</h3>
                            <p>We developed a few personas based on goals and needs. Below is one of them and I will be using him to guide my designs.</p>
                            <a href="img/iriS/Persona.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="img/iriS/Persona.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>
                            <p>Joe can call iriS while driving "Find me a 4 start yelp rating Japanese restaurant near X, I want to know if they have parking, and if it has this dish xxx." <br><br>Joe can also ask "I want to go to a cool event tonight, near xxx address. Please find me 3 of them and let me know?" </p><br>


                            <h3>Onboarding Flow</h3>
                            <p>This is my design to get new users onboard</p>
                            <a href="img/iriS/flow.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/iriS/flow.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></a><br>    

                            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                            <p>From the information that I have, I skeched these wireframes out. The goal is to keep this app simple but informative. Easy to use. I have sketched other variations, they all have their good points and trade-offs. I chose this one because I think it matches what I want the users to experience th best.</p>

                            <p>I want the Icon to be simple and elegent. I gave the team several ideas and we finally decided on this one.It goes with the typeface I designed for this app. It represents the fact that this product can help users get their jobs done nice and quickly.</p>
