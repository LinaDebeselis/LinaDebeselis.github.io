							<h2>Mobile First - Web Design for Telecure</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Telecure is a telemedicine company that treats common conditions over the phone. </p><br>
                            <h3>Problem</h3>
                            <p>Telecure's landing page is not working very well on mobile devices. Today, almost 1/4 of the Web's traffic comes from mobile. If Telecure didn't build a responsive site, they are losing a quarter of their users.</p><br>
                            <h3>Project</h3>
                            <p>This project is to improve the existing Telecure landing page (up until July, 2014). The landing page is not mobile responsive and is not optimized. <br><br> Key Pain Points: <br>• Website design/style is not consistent <br>• Font sizes/leadings make it harder for users to read/understand <br>• Unnecessary space with no information given <br>• Unclear value proposition<br>• Content is not optimized for mobile users<br>• Website is not trustworthy enough <br></p>
                            <h3>The old Telecure Landing Page</h3>
                            <p>Desktop Version<br>I highlighted some of the parts that need to be optimized or removed.</p>

                            <img src="img/telecure/origin.png" class="image featured" alt=""><br>
                            <p>Mobile Version</p>
                            <a href="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo1.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo1.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a>
                            <a href="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo2.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo2.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a>
                            <a href="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo3.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureoldCombo3.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a>
                            <p>As you can see, their old landing page really needs to be optimized.</p><br>
                            <h3>Mobile First</h3>
                            <p>The challenge here is to avoid as many differences as possible as the widths of the devices change. I want to aim for a beautiful user experience for all of them. </p><br>

                            <h3>My Role</h3>
                            <p>My goal here is to tackle all the major pain points listed above and to improve the overall Telecure website experience. I researched, wireframed and re-designed the website. I tried to maintain their original design framework as requested by the client.<br>
                            <p>Telecure also decided to use "zombie people" (shown below) in their design, and I was asked to apply these characters. I also added a page for their new iOS app.</p>
                            <a href="img/telecure/ZomPeople.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/ZomPeople.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br>
                            <h3>Who Am I Designing For?</h3>
                            <p>There are mostly 3 types of people Telecure is targeting at.<br>• People who do not have insurance and have difficulty accessing any doctors;<br>• People who do have insurance but they are in a rush (for example, traveling) and cannot wait long to make appointments with doctors;<br>• People with insurance who do not mind spending some money to save themselves some time.</p><br><br>
                            <p>They also share one thing in common - they all need trustworthy medical help fast. So the Telecure website really should be able to offer the information they need so they can be convinced.</p><br>

                            <h3>Start From Sketches</h3>
                            <p>I started to sketch some of the key screens. The idea is to keep the website consistent through out each section.</p><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/sketch01.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/sketch01.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/sketch02.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/sketch02.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br>
                             <h3>Style Guide</h3>
                             <p>Once I have the rough idea of how the website should go, I started to develope a rough style guide. It helps keep the design consistent. I discussed this with the developer and we agreed on the brand colors. From there, I developed the style guide as shown below.(I also referenced <a href="http://www.typogui.de/" target="_blank"> this website</a> for Typography advices.</p>
                             <a href="img/telecure/styleguide.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/styleguide.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br>


                            <h3>Mobile Design</h3><br>
                            <p>After the wireframes, I started to design the high-fidelity prototypes. Using the style guide, I was able to keep the design consistent. I believe that the pain points I listed earlier were all solved with this design. The final version was shown to the clients and they were happy with it :)<br>This is what it looks like on different devices as shown below.</p>
                            <p>iPhone 5/5s</p><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/telecureCombo1.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureCombo1.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/telecureCombo2.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureCombo2.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <p>iPad samples</p><br>
                             <a href="img/telecure/telecureipadCombo.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureipadCombo.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br><br>
                             <p>Desktop version</p><br><br> 
                             <p>As you can see, while the width of the device increases, the content change slightly. More "zombie people" are added to the background. "How it works" expanded into one line, etc.</p>

                            <a href="img/telecure/telecureimacCombo.png" target="_blank"><img src="img/telecure/telecureimacCombo.png" class="image featured" alt=""></a><br><br>
