			<p>This was an album cover design I did for an Atlanta based rock band named Swank Sinatra. Their album title was "Pretty Shoes"
			</p>
			<p>This band does very high energy live performances with unexpected humarous acts. Their fans enjoy that about them. The design challenge here was to create a high energy cover that is rock n roll + humar that the band approves and their fans can resonate.
			</p>
			<p>Sketches were developed through out brianstorming with the band, researching on relavent materials, etc. Once the design idea was formed, I digitized the sketch and started coloring</p>
			<p>Various color combinations were offered. The band chose the orange-red version - which is also my favorite!</p>
			<p><strong>My Role Here:</strong> <strong>Ideation</strong>, <strong>Design</strong>, <strong>Art Direction</strong>, <strong>Branding</strong></p><br>
			<p>Shipped: June 2012</p>
